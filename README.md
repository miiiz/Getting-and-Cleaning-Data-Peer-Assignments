# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Peer-Assignments
THIS FILE DESCRIBES HOW SCRIPTS WORK.
* First, get the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
  Rename the folder with "data". The folder "data" and the run_analysis.R script should be both in the current working directory.
* Second, use source("run_analysis.R") command in RStudio. 
* Third, two txt files are generated:
  - merged.txt: it contains a data frame called cleanedData.
  - means.txt: it contains a data frame called result.
